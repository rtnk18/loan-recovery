# Loan Recovery Analysis
A Statistical analysis to understand how much a bank must spend on a non-performing loan without incurring losses.

After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered to be "charged-off." But that doesn't mean the bank simply walks away from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. 

The bank will score the account to assess the expected recovery amount, that is, the expected amount that the bank may be able to receive from the customer in the future (for a fixed time period such as one year). This amount is a function of the probability of the customer paying, the total debt, and other factors that impact the ability and willingness to pay.

The greater the expected recovery amount, the more effort the bank puts into contacting the customer. For higher recovery strategies, the bank incurs more costs as they leverage human resources in more efforts to contact the customer and obtain payments.

I have analyzed whether the extra amount that is recovered at the higher strategy level exceed the extra costs put in by the bank.
